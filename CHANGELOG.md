# Changelog
All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [1.36.2] - 2022-03-28

### Changed

- Handle Divide by zero error when campaign traffic is zero.

## [1.36.1] - 2022-14-03

### Changed

- Update key for reading Data Residency Location from `dataResidencyLocation` to `collectionPrefix`

## [1.36.0] - 2022-24-02

### Changed

- Removed the dependency of hard-coding paths for reading the log messages. Moved the file reading logic to vwo-sdk-log-messages repo.

## [1.35.0] - 2022-23-02

### Added

- Always check targeting conditions

  - The option `Once` is selected by default in the VWO Application, which means the user segment condition is only checked once and the same variation is served to the user on every subsequent call to the SDK's APIs.

  - If you choose `Always`, the user is evaluated against the segment condition on every call to the SDK's APIs.

## [1.32.0] - 2022-28-01

### Changed

- Instead of multiple tracking calls in case of global goals, now one single batch call will be made to track different goals of different campaigns having same goal-identifier.
- Instead of multiple tracking calls in case of pushing more than one custom dimension, now one single batch call will be made to push custom dimension map.

## [1.31.0] - 2022-17-01

### Changed

- Integrated VWO SDK Log Messages repo instead of hardcoding messages in every VWO server-side SDK.
- Old logs are revamped. New logs that would help in better debugging are added.

## [1.30.0] - 2022-11-01

### Changed

- Tracking data for the `Data Residency` enabled VWO accounts will be sent to the configured location
- Update year in all the copyright and liense headers

## [1.28.0] - 2021-12-09

### Changed

- In case you want to opt out of tracking by VWO, simply call the `setOptOut` API. This will exclude all the users from any kind of tracking by VWO. This is useful when you just want to make the VWO SDK ineffective without actually removing the associated code.

  `setOptOut` API will also remove unwanted memory footprint by destructing all the instance variables. Calling any other API after this will not be effective i.e. no decision-making or impression would be made to VWO.

  ```php
  $vwoClientInstance->setOptOut();
  ```

  If you want to opt-in again for tracking by VWO SDK, reinitialize the SDK with the latest settings.

## [1.25.0] - 2021-12-08

### Added

- Support for pushing multiple custom dimensions at once. Earlier, you had to call push API multiple times for tracking multiple custom dimensions as follows:

    ```php
    $vwoInstance->push('browser', 'chrome', $userId);
    $vwoInstance->push('price', '20', $userId);
    ```

    Now, you can pass an associative array

    ```php
    $customDimensionMap = [
    "browser" => 'chrome',
    "price" => '20'
    ];
    $vwoInstance->push($customDimensionMap, $userId);
    ```

    Multiple asynchronous tracking calls would be initiated in this case.

### Changed

- If Events Architecture is enabled for your VWO account, all the tracking calls being initiated from SDK would now be `POST` instead of `GET` and there would be single endpoint i.e. `/events/t`. This is done in order to bring events support and building advanced capabilities in future.

- For events architecture accounts, tracking same goal across multiple campaigns will not send multiple tracking calls. Instead, one single `POST` call would be made to track the same goal across multiple different campaigns running on the same environment.

- Multiple custom dimension can be pushed via `push` API. For events architecture enabled account, only one single asynchronous call would be made to track multiple custom dimensions.

```php
$customDimensionMap = [
  "browser" => 'chrome',
  "price" => '20'
];
$vwoInstance->push($customDimensionMap, $userId);
```

## [1.24.0] - 2020-12-08

### Changed

- User IDs passed while applying whitelisting in a campaign from VWO Application will now be hashed. Inside settings-file, all User IDs will be hashed for security reasons. SDK will hash the User ID passed in the different APIs before matching it with the campaigns settings. This is feature-controlled from VWO i.e. we are only rolling this functionality gradually. Please reach out to the support team in case you want to opt-in early for this feature for your VWO account.

## [1.23.2] - 2020-10-21

### Changed

- Updated whitelisting logs for Feature Rollout campaign
- Test cases added to verify whitelisting cases in Feature Rollout campaign

## [1.23.1] - 2021-10-07

### Changed

- Fixed the validation logic for JSON type variable

## [1.23.0] - 2021-09-29

### Changed

- Remove `shouldTrackReturningVisitor` option as FullStack campaigns show unique visitors and conversions count. Duplicate visitors/conversions tracking calls would not be made if User Storage Service is used.
- Update name of usage metrics keys. Start sending `_l` flag to notify VWO server whether to log or not.

## [1.22.0] - 2021-08-12

### Changed

- Use Campaign ID along with User ID for bucketing a user in a campaign. This will ensure that a particular user gets different variation for different campaigns having similar settings i.e. same campaign-traffic, number of variations, and variation traffic.

## [1.20.0] - 2021-08-06

### Changed

- Sending visitor tracking call for Feature Rollout campaign when `isFeatureEnabled` API is used. This will help in visualizing the overall traffic for the respective campaign's report in the VWO application.

## [1.19.0] - 2021-07-30

### Added
- Introducing support for Mutually Exclusive Campaigns. By creating Mutually Exclusive Groups in VWO Application, you can group multiple FullStack A/B campaigns together that are mutually exclusive. SDK will ensure that visitors do not overlap in multiple running mutually exclusive campaigns and the same visitor does not see the unrelated campaign variations. This eliminates the interaction effects that multiple campaigns could have with each other. You simply need to configure the group in the VWO application and the SDK will take care what to be shown to the visitor when you will call the `activate` API for a given user and a campaign.

## [1.18.0] - 2021-07-12

### Added

- Feature Rollout and Feature Test campaigns now supports `JSON` type variable which can be created inside VWO Application. This will help in storing grouped and structured data.

## [1.17.0] - 2021-06-02

## Added

- Campaign name will be available in settings and hence, changed settings-schema validations.
- campaignName will be available in integrations callback, if callback is defined.

## [1.15.0] - 2021-04-29

### Added

- Sending stats which are used for launching the SDK like storage service, logger, and integrations, etc. in tracking calls(track-user). This is solely for debugging purpose. We are only sending whether a particular key is used not the actual value of the key.

### Changed
- Removed sending user-id, that is provided in the various APIs, in the tracking calls to VWO server as it might contain sensitive PII data.
- SDK Key will not be logged in any log message, for example, tracking call logs.

## [1.14.0] - 2021-03-22

### Added

- Expose lifecycle hook events. This feature allows sending VWO data to third party integrations.

### Changed

- Introduce `integrations` key in `VWO` class constructor's argument to enable receiving hooks for the third party integrations.

```php
$config = [
    'settingsFile' => $settingsFile,
    'integrations' => [
        'callback' => function ($properties) {
            // $properties will contain all the required VWO specific information
        }
    ]
];

$vwoClientInstance = new VWO($config);
```

## [1.13.1] - 2021-03-18

### Changed

- If User Storage Service is implemented, `isFeatureEnabled` API for not considering variation-level feature flag for Feature Test type campaign.

## [1.13.0] - 2021-03-03

### Changed

- Update track API to support tracking a goal globally across campaigns with the same `goalIdentififer` and corresponding changes in `VWO` class constructor.

```php
// it will track goal having `goalIdentifier` of campaign having `campaignKey` for the user having `userId` as id.
$vwoClientInstance->track("campaignKey", $goalIdentifier, $userId, $options);
// it will track goal having `goalIdentifier` of campaigns having `campaignKey1` and `campaignKey2` for the user having `userId` as id.
$vwoClientInstance->track(["campaignKey1", "campaignKey2"], $goalIdentifier, $userId, $options);
// it will track goal having `goalIdentifier` of all the campaigns
$vwoClientInstance->track(null, $goalIdentifier, $userId, $options);
//Read more about configuration and usage - https://developers.vwo.com/reference#server-side-sdk-track
```

- If User Storage Service is provided, do not track same visitor multiple times.

You can pass `shouldTrackReturningUser` as `true` in case you prefer to track duplicate visitors.

```php
$options = [
  "shouldTrackReturningUser" => true
];

$vwoClientInstance->activate($campaignKey, $userId, $options);
```

Or, you can also pass `shouldTrackReturningUser` at the time of instantiating VWO SDK client. This will avoid passing the flag in different API calls.

```php
$config=[
  'settingsFile' => $settingsFile,
  'shouldTrackReturningUser' => true
];

$vwoClientInstance = new VWO($config);
```

If `shouldTrackReturningUser` param is passed at the time of instantiating the SDK as well as in the API options as mentioned above, then the API options value will be considered.

- If User Storage Service is provided, campaign activation is mandatory before tracking any goal, getting variation of a campaign, and getting value of the feature's variable.

**Correct Usage**

```php
$vwoClientInstance->activate($campaignKey, $userId, $options);
$vwoClientInstance->track($campaignKey, $userId, $goalIdentifier, $options);
```

**Wrong Usage**

```php
// Calling track API before activate API
// This will not track goal as campaign has not been activated yet.
$vwoClientInstance->track($campaignKey, $userId, $goalIdentifier, $options);

// After calling track APi
$vwoClientInstance->activate($campaignKey, $userId, $options);
```

## [1.12.0] - 2020-02-19

### Changed

- Send environment token in every network call initiated from SDK to the VWO server. This will help in viewing campaign reports on the basis of environment.

## [1.11.1] - 2020-02-08

### Changed

## [1.11.0] - 2020-01-14

### Changed

- Make VWO tracking calls asynchronous by using socket connection. This reduces the overall execution time of tracking APIs - `activate`, `isFeatureEnabled`, `track`, and `push` as the SDK is not blocked on the response of such tracking calls.

## [1.10.0] - 2020-01-13

### Added

- Bugfixes
  - pre-segmentation logging issue when evaluated to false
  - sending call in case of feature-test when Control is the decision

## [1.7.4] - 2020-05-14
### Changed
- Return `null` from APIs in case user is not part of campaign

## [1.7.3] - 2020-05-12
### Changed
- Fixed and added new test cases for feature rollout and validation checks
- Mock server-calls, thereby, test-cases execution time reduced from ~1.5 minutes to only ~500ms

### Changed
- Fix variable naming and update `README.md` file

## [1.7.1] - 2020-04-29
### Changed

- Added `composer.lock` into `.gitignore` file.

## [1.6.0] - 2020-03-05
### Breaking Changes
To prevent ordered arguments and increasing use-cases, we are moving all optional arguments into a combined argument(Associative Array).

- customVariables argument in APIs: `activate`, `getVariation`, `track`, `isFeatureEnabled`, and `getFeatureVariableValue` have been moved into `options`.
- `revenueValue` parameter in `track` API is now moved into `options` argument.

#### Before

```php
// activae API
$vwoClient->activate($campaignKey, $userId, $customVariables);
// getVariation API
$vwoClient->getVariation($campaignKey, $userId, $customVariables);
// track API
$vwoClient->track($campaignKey, $userId, $goalIdentifier, $revenueValue, $customVariables);
// isFeatureEnabled API
$vwoClient->isFeatureEnabled($campaignKey, $userId, $customVariables);
// getFeatureVariableValue API
$vwoClient->getFeatureVariableValue($campaignKey, $variableKey, $userId, $customVariables);
```

#### After

```php

$options = [];
$options["customVariables"] = [];
  // Optional, neeeded for Forced Variation
$options["variationTargetingVariables"] = [];

// activae API
$vwoClient->activate($campaignKey, $userId, $options);
// getVariation API
$vwoClient->getVariation($campaignKey, $userId, $options);
// track API
  // Optional, needed to track revenue goal with revenue value
$options["revenueValue"] = 1000.12;
$vwoClient->track($campaignKey, $userId, $goalIdentifier, options);
// isFeatureEnabled API
$vwoClient->isFeatureEnabled($campaignKey, $userId, $options);
// getFeatureVariableValue API
$vwoClient->getFeatureVariableValue($campaignKey, $variableKey, $userId, $options);
```
